The bright packaging and the ability to choose my colour attracted me to the listing and the fact that I can prepare 9 meals with a very generous portion size for my baby at one time is a massive advantage to me as a working mum. I can freeze the tray easily as it comes with a very easy clip on lid that also protects from freezer burn. I have found I can also put the baby food tray in the dishwasher fine.
